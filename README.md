This project is a copy of the project https://github.com/gurrenm3/Toast-Notifications-with-.Net-Maui by @gurrenm3 and serves as help support for the contributions https://github.com/gurrenm3/Toast-Notifications-with-.Net-Maui/issues/2 and https://github.com/dotnet/maui-samples/issues/560.

The real problem with the current MAUI Windows local notification is that you can generate a notification in the Windows system with MAUI Win-Desktop App without any problems, but I do not get back the ID passed to the system notification when the app is started again by the system (when user clicks on the notification). As a result, the app is opened, but the corresponding data record cannot be determined because the ID is missing (e.g. if you create a calendar app, the ID would be a calendar entry that is displayed to the user after automatically opening the app via the local notification. At the moment, the user has to search for the entry themselves, which is of course nonsense).
